# Overview

These are a few scripts I've put together to try to help me with managing git branches

## branch_helper

Designed to help find names of branches with a fuzzy search

## switch_helper
Script that takes a keyword and then helps you change to branches which match that information

### Usage
./switch_helper.sh remote

- Lists all branches (local and remote) which contain "remote" (case insensitively). 
- It shows the branches in pages of 10 and you can change to the branch using the number it assigns.
